# TriviaGame

Think you know it all? Let's test your street smarts!

* When the player clicks on "Begin Trivia" a countdown timer will begin from 60 seconds. 

* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly, incorrectly and skipped.

* There is only one answer per question.

* Once the player clicks on "Finished", the players stats will be shown on a new page.
